## üìå **Project Overview:**  
This project dives deep into **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Neural Networks** to explore the relationship between **Ad Spending** and **Revenue**. It integrates advanced machine learning techniques like **Manual Gradient Descent** and **Custom Loss Functions** to optimize model performance effectively.

## üî• **Key Features:**  
1. **Linear Regression:** Predicts **revenue** based on ad spending, understanding ROI.  
2. **Logistic Regression:** Classifies revenue into categories like **"High"** or **"Low"** for strategic decision-making.  
3. **Neural Networks:** Utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for advanced pattern detection.  
4. **Manual Gradient Descent:** Shows the optimization process for model training.  
5. **Custom Loss Functions:** Implements **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Cross-Entropy Loss** for accurate evaluations.  
6. **Visualization:** Creates insightful graphs for easy interpretation of results.

## üíº **Real-World Problem & Unique Use Case:**  
### **Problem:**  
Traditional advertising analysis often fails to capture complex, non-linear patterns in ROI. Many businesses still rely on basic regression without leveraging neural networks, leading to suboptimal ad spending strategies.

### **Unique Solution:**  
This project's combination of **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Neural Networks** can be applied to optimize advertising for niche markets, such as **non-profit fundraising campaigns**. These campaigns often struggle to maximize donations while keeping ad spending low. Using this optimized approach can help:

- Predict potential donations based on ad budget (Linear Regression).
- Classify donation categories (Logistic Regression).
- Identify non-linear patterns and maximize impact (Neural Networks).

Most businesses lack this advanced approach, making it a **highly valuable, yet underutilized strategy**.
